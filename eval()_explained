# we have an array called arr
# command "append 1": Append  to the list, arr = [1].
# command "append 2": Append  to the list, arr = [1, 2]
# command "insert 3 1": Insert 3 at index 1, arr= [1, 3, 2]
# command print: Print the array.
#Output:          
         [1, 3, 2]
            
# insert i e: Insert integer  at position .
# print: Print the list.
# remove e: Delete the first occurrence of integer .
# append e: Insert integer  at the end of the list.
# sort: Sort the list.
# pop: Pop the last element from the list.
# reverse: Reverse the list.
